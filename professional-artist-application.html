        PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION BEFORE APPLYING
      </h5>
      <h6>Length of dances:</h6>
      <p>Approximately 4-12 minutes. 18 min max.</p>
      <br />
      <h6>Footwear:</h6>
      <p>Only bare feet or socks are allowed on the dance floor.</p>
      <br />
      <h6>Other:</h6>
      <p>No helium balloons, confetti, glitter.</p>
      <br />
      <h6>Techs:</h6>
      <p>
        Prior to arriving at the festival, all companies will complete an online
        questionnaire about lighting and music cues. Dances that rely heavily on
        specific and/or extensive lighting and sound cues will need to be
        simplified. Please note that we cannot project video as part of your
        dance performance. We cannot accommodate large or numerous set pieces
        that require a lengthy set up or breakdown. Techs could start as early
        as Thursday night for local artists. All other artists should be
        prepared to attend techs on Friday and/or Saturday.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>Apply:</h6>
      <p>
        Read the APPLICATION FAQS below. Prepare a vimeo or YouTube link to a
        video of the work you want to perform at the festival as well as a 50
        word or less description of you, your work in general, and/or the
        specific piece you are submitting. Now you are ready to complete the
        Google Form application. The link is in the FAQs. To complete the
        submission process, pay your $40 application fee via PayPal or Venmo to
        Kathy Dunn Hamrick Dance Company, the festival’s producing organization.
        When paying, put the name of your dance in the comment section.

      <h5 style="margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">APPLICATION FAQS</h5>
      <h6>How do you select the works?</h6>
      <p>
        A diverse group of choreographers, educators, and dance writers from
        across the country will review artist submissions and make
        recommendations based upon factors such as creativity and innovation,
        development of ideas, choreographic structure, execution, diversity, and
        historical, social, and cultural perspectives. The Executive Director
        will use the recommendations to curate showcases that highlight superior
        work in the broad field of modern dance, that demonstrate equitable
        representation, and that showcase a variety of local, regional, and
        national work. We also consider time/space parameters, number of
        dancers, and tone when making final programming decisions. Our goal is
        to curate a festival of dance that is diverse, compelling, entertaining,
        and of the highest possible artistic quality. Even so, we will end up
        having to eliminate many wonderful dances. If you are not selected,
        please consider applying again.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>Can I submit more than one piece?</h6>
      <p>
        Yes, you may submit two pieces, but because your applications will go to
        different panelists, you must repeat the entire application process for
        the additional dance. Two dances? Two applications and two payments.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>What type of work are you looking for?</h6>
      <p>
        Austin Dance Festival presents modern, post-modern, contemporary, and
        improvisational dance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>Can I specifically request to perform at a particular show?</h6>
      <p>
        No. We do not accommodate special requests for rehearsal or performance
        times. By applying to the festival, you agree to perform in either show
        and to attend a spacing rehearsal and a production meeting prior to your
        performance. Please read the information under TECHS above.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>
        Can my video submission be a rehearsal video? Does it have to be of the
        dance I will be performing?
      </h6>
      <p>
        Please submit a performance or rehearsal video of the dance you want to
        perform at the festival. See the PRO TIPS near the bottom of the FAQs
        for more information on your video submission.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>How will I know if I’ve been selected?</h6>
      <p>
        All applicants will receive an email notification about the status of
        your submission(s). Please check your spam folders! If you are selected,
        you will be asked to promptly accept our invitation and send a
        professional photo for ADF marketing materials. If you do not meet our
        acceptance deadline, we will give your spot to another artist. Artists
        who are not selected this year are strongly encouraged to apply again
        next year.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>Why wasn’t I selected?</h6>
      <p>
        Not being selected is not a commentary on the value of your work. It is
        unfortunate that space and time prevent us from accepting every
        submission. When making programming decisions, we consider a variety of
        factors including the tone of the dance, the length of the dance, the
        number of dancers, and even where the company is based. We also work
        within a very precise and limited amount of time and space, so it’s like
        working a puzzle as we try to “fit” dances together for a concert. We do
        not provide feedback to applicants who are not selected. If you are not
        selected this year, please consider applying again and give us another
        opportunity to show your work.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>Do participants receive a stipend?</h6>
      <p>
        Local dance companies receive a $150 stipend. Companies traveling more
        than 60 miles receive a $250 stipend. Companies from out-of-state
        receive a $400 stipend. Companies should be prepared to cover costs to
        attend the festival, including, but not limited to, food, parking,
        lodging, and transportation.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h6>PRO TIPS:</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your video submission should be a complete video, from beginning to
          end, of the work as you plan to perform it. Video samples of previous
          work will not be considered. Unfinished works will not be considered.
        </li>
        <li>
          Send a clear, unobstructed, unedited video (or the best you can!).
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure your video is public and that we have permission to view it.
          If it is password protected, include the password in your application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Send your video link to two people and make sure they can open and
          view it before you include it in your application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember to pay your application fee through PayPal and to include the
          title of your dance on the payment form.
        </li>
      </ul>
