	<p>Companies will be asked to send music prior to the festival. On the day of the concert, all directors and dancers gather onstage and meet with our production staff for details on entering, exiting, and bows. (Please have a simple bow prepared upon arrival.) Our production team will provide a professional lighting design that will be used by all companies. Companies will be given only a few minutes to space dances.</p>
	<br>

	<p>Read the following APPLICATION FAQS, then fill out a Google Form</a> and pay your $35 application fee via PayPal. The link to the google form is at the end of the FAQs.</p>

	<h5 style="margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">APPLICATION FAQS</h5>
	<h6>How do you select the works?</h6>
	<p>A panel of curators from across the country views applications and makes selection recommendations to a team of artistic directors and production staff. This team makes final curatorial decisions based on the adjudicators’ comments and on the festival’s overall programming needs. We also consider our time/space parameters, number of dancers, tone, and even where the company is based, when making final programming decisions. Our goal is to curate a festival of dance that is diverse, compelling, entertaining, and of the highest possible artistic quality.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>Can I submit more than one piece?</h6>
	<p>Yes, you may submit two pieces, but because your applications will go to different panelists, you must repeat the entire application process for the additional dance. Two dances? Two applications and two payments.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>What type of work are you looking for?</h6>
	<p>Austin Dance Festival’s Youth Edition presents modern/contemporary dances.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>Can I submit a solo?</h6>
	<p>Only solos submitted by pre-professional company directors will be reviewed by our panel of curators.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>Can my video submission be a rehearsal video? Does it have to be of the dance I will be performing?</h6>
	<p>Please submit a performance or rehearsal video of the dance you want to perform at the festival.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>How will I know if I’ve been selected?</h6>
	<p>All applicants will receive an email notification regarding submissions. Check your spam folders! If you are selected, you will be asked to promptly accept our invitation and send a professional photo for ADF marketing materials. If you do not meet our acceptance deadline, we will assume you are not interested in participating and will give your spot to another artist. Artists who are not selected this year are strongly encouraged to apply again next year.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>Why wasn’t I selected?</h6>
	<p>Not being selected is not a commentary on the value of your work. It is unfortunate that space and time prevent us from accepting every submission. When making programming decisions, we consider a variety of factors including the tone of the dance, the length of the dance, the number of dancers, and even where the company is based. We also work within a very precise and limited amount of time and space, so it’s like working a puzzle as we try to “fit” dances together for a concert. We do not provide feedback to applicants who are not selected. If you are not selected this year, please consider applying again and give us another opportunity to show your work.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>I’ve read through the guidelines and FAQs, and I still have a question!</h6>
	<p>No problem. Contact Roxy Gage: <a href="roxy@austindancefestival.com">roxy@austindancefestival.com</a></p>
