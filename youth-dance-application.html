Companies will be given only a few minutes to space dances.</p>

	<h5 style="margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">APPLICATION FAQS</h5>
	<h6>How do you select the works?</h6>
	<p>The festival directors strive to represent a wide range of modern dances from local, regional, and national youth dance companies. We look for submissions that are fully-realized pieces of choreography, that are well-rehearsed, and that are executed in a highly-proficient manner. The dances must also meet the guidelines above, including but not limited to, age range and length of dance.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>Can I submit more than one piece?</h6>
	<p>Yes, you may submit two pieces, but because your applications will go to different panelists, you must repeat the entire application process for the additional dance. Two dances? Two applications and two payments.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>What type of work are you looking for?</h6>
	<p>Austin Dance Festival’s Youth Edition presents modern, post-modern, and contemporary dances.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>Can I submit a solo?</h6>
	<p>Only solos submitted by pre-professional company directors will be reviewed by our panel of curators.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>Can my video submission be a rehearsal video? Does it have to be of the dance I will be performing?</h6>
	<p>Please submit a performance or rehearsal video of the dance you want to perform at the festival.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>How will I know if I’ve been selected?</h6>
	<p>All applicants will receive an email notification regarding submissions. Check your spam folders! If you are selected, you will be asked to promptly accept our invitation and send a professional photo for ADF marketing materials. If you do not meet our acceptance deadline, we will assume you are not interested in participating and will give your spot to another artist. Artists who are not selected this year are strongly encouraged to apply again next year.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>Why wasn’t I selected?</h6>
	<p>Not being selected is not a commentary on the value of your work. It is unfortunate that space and time prevent us from accepting every submission. When making programming decisions, we consider a variety of factors including the tone of the dance, the length of the dance, the number of dancers, and even where the company is based. We also work within a very precise and limited amount of time and space, so it’s like working a puzzle as we try to “fit” dances together for a concert. We do not provide feedback to applicants who are not selected. If you are not selected this year, please consider applying again and give us another opportunity to show your work.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>I’ve read through the guidelines and FAQs, and I still have a question!</h6>
	<p>No problem. Contact Roxy Gage: <a href="roxy@austindancefestival.com">roxy@austindancefestival.com</a></p>
	<br>
	<h6>Where is the application?</h6>
